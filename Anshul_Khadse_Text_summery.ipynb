This medicine works by attacking the bacteria that cause these pimples.Acnesol Gel is only meant for external use and should be used as advised by your doctor. You should normally wash and dry the affected area before applying a thin layer of the medicine. It should not be applied to broken or damaged skin. Avoid any contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Rinse it off with water if you accidentally get it in these areas. It may take several weeks for your symptoms to improve, but you should keep using this medicine regularly. Do not stop using it as soon as your acne starts to get better. Ask your doctor when you should stop treatment.Common side effects like minor itching, burning, or redness of the skin and oily skin may be seen in some people. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. Consult your doctor if they bother you or do not go away.It is a safe medicine, but you should inform your doctor if you have any problems with your bowels (intestines). Also, inform the doctor if you have ever had bloody diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics or if you are using any other medicines to treat skin conditions. Consult your doctor about using this medicine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.'"

It is used to treat infections of the lungs (e.g., pneumonia), ear, nasal sinus, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue. It will not work for viral infections such as the common cold.Augmentin 625 Duo Tablet is best taken with a meal to reduce the chance of a stomach upset. You should take it regularly at evenly spaced intervals as per the schedule prescribed by your doctor. Taking it at the same time every day will help you to remember to take it. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for, but you should always complete a full course of this antibiotic as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it until you have finished, even when you feel better. If you stop taking it early, some bacteria may survive and the infection may come back or worsen.The most common side effects of this medicine include vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild but let your doctor know if they bother you or will not go away.Before taking it, let your doctor know if you are allergic to any antibiotics or have any kidney or liver problems. You should also let your healthcare team know about all other medicines you are taking as they may affect, or be affected by, this medicine. This medicine is generally regarded as safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding if prescribed by a doctor.'"
